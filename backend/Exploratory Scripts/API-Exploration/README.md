# API Exploration
(as of 18 Oct)
1. roads and cams </br>
    -> use folium to visualise the speedbands and cameras we have so that we can decide which points to use and how to calculate the speed
2. geospatial layers </br>
    -> used to display road items eg. ERP gantries, Arrow Markings and Lane Lines (not sure how to use as of now) </br>
    -> uploaded onto shp file viewer app to view
