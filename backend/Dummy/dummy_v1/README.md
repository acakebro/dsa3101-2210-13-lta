# Dummy Test

(as of 20 Oct 2022) </br>

- inputs would be the `dnn_model` folder, `vehicle_detector.py` and `Image_ROI.csv` </br>
- this code runs the API call and stores the images in a dataframe (doesn't download into folders) </br>
- it calculates the car counts of cameras 1001 and 1002 by its different ROI/Directions </br>
- you would have to click any key 6 times </br>
- then it fills in dummy values for the length, speed, density and the remaining car counts </br>
- output should be a printed df </br>

Instructions: </br>

1. download `dnn_model` folder, `Image_ROI.csv` and `dummy_20_oct.py` </br>
2. download `yolov4.weights` from telegram and add it to the `dnn_model` folder \*\*\* </br>
3. open `dummy_20_oct.py` </br>
4. edit directories in `dummy_20_oct.py` </br>
5. run `dummy_20_oct.py` </br>
6. at the car counting section, the image window will appear, this is just to view the image and understand the results better (may be removed in final code) </br>
7. click any key to go to the next image (6 times) </br>
