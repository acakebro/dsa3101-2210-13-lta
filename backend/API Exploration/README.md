API Exploration (as of 18 Oct):
1. roads and cams
    -> use folium to visualise the speedbands and cameras we have so that we can decide which points to use and how to calculate the speed
2. geospatial layers 
    -> used to display road items eg. ERP gantries, Arrow Markings and Lane Lines (not sure how to use as of now)
    -> uploaded onto shp file viewer app to view
